Kitchen Display System

Dalviroo is hypothetical  an on-demand food delivery company and our operations revolve around that single concept. Stores receive a daily prediction of sales numbers, which in turn helps to pre-prep the food before usual rush. And help decide how much of each raw material needs to be in ready state. For every order that is created, workers on kitchen display mark it as “done” which automatically increase “created-till-now” column for that product
